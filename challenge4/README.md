Professor S. has a set of C coin pouches numbered from 0 to C - 1. She has
donated P of the C pouches and calculated the sum of the numbers of removed pouches.

Professor S. wanted to give you a Christmas treat: She told you that the sum is
divisible by C. *Compute the number of ways of removing P pouches from the initial set.*

**Note:** Output the answer modulo 10^{9} + 7.

You also have to come up with representative test cases and make sure that the answer is computed correctly in reasonable time. Try for large numbers of C and P, say C=1,000,000 and P = 50,000.
