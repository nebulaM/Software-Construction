# go-examples
A sequence of examples providing a Java introduction -- using Pokemon Go for context

To run through these examples, clone this GitHub repository to your local machine. Then use any editor and C compiler to experiment with the C example. For the Java examples, I recommend using Eclipse.

**Read the source code and play with the examples so that you are comfortable with making your own variations.**

## Obtaining the source code

To clone this GitHub repository, use `git bash` on Windows or a terminal with macOS or Linux-based operating system. I recommend first changing the operating directory to your Eclipse workspace directory. This depends on where the directory is located on your machine. For example, on Windows, I might type the following command in `git bash`:

```cd /c/users/gsathish/workspace```

And on macOS, I might use the following command at the terminal:

```cd /Users/gsathish/workspace```

Once you are in the appropriate directory, use:

```git clone https://github.com/CPEN-221/go-examples```

If I cloned the repository from the directory `/Users/gsathish/workspace` then the cloning operation will create a sub-directory `go-examples` in the directory `/Users/gsathish/workspace`. (You can check which directory you are working in using the command `pwd` for 'present working directory').

Once you have cloned the repository, if I add more examples to this repository, you can go to the `go-examples` directory and use the command `git pull` to refresh the repository.

## Compiling and Running Programs

For C programs, use your favourite editor and compiler (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio C, `gcc`).

For Java programs, I recommed using Eclipse. You will open each example in `go-examples` as a separate project. From the Eclipse menu, you can create a new Java project and select the directory for the source code (such as `example1-java`).

## Example 1
where we can print a list of names

* `example1-c`: an elementary example in C
* `example1-java`: the same example in Java
