	/**
	 * Given an integer n, this method returns a string that represents the
	 * prime factorization of n.
	 * 
	 * The prime numbers that are factors of n must appear in ascending order in
	 * the returned string.
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Examples:
	 * </p>
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>N = 8. The returned string should be "2^3" where "^" refers to
	 * exponentiation.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>N = 12. The returned string should be "2^2 * 3" where "*" represents
	 * multiplication.</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>N = 7. The returned string should be "7".</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>N = 1764. The returned string should be "2^2 * 3^2 * 7^2".</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>N = 210. The returned string should be "2 * 3 * 5 * 7".</li>
	 * 
	 * <li>N = 1. The returned string should be "1". Note that 1 is a special
	 * case because 1 is not considered a prime number.</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * 
	 * @param n
	 *            should be greater than or equal to 1.
	 * @return a String that represents the proper prime factorization of N with
	 *         the prime factors in ascending order and with the correct
	 *         exponents. Exponentiation is indicated using ^ and multiplication
	 *         using *. White space between symbols is maintained as per the
	 *         examples.
